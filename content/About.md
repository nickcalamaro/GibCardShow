The Gibraltar Card Show is Gibraltar’s official Trading Card and TCG events space — built to unite collectors and players while putting Gibraltar firmly on the international map of the hobby.

Founded by PB Card Shack, Southern Light TCG, and Wise Collector TCG, we’re the home for trading-card events on the Rock, from our flagship Gibraltar Card Show to high-energy Trade Nights where the community buys, sells, trades, and connects.

We collaborate with Dice Bastion (Gibraltar Warhammer Club) — the Rock’s leading professionals in tournament adjudication and seasoned collectors — to deliver fair, well-run competitions and a premium attendee experience.

Above all, we’re safeguarding-first: a safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment for every attendee, from first-time collectors and families to experienced traders. Enjoy the hobby with confidence — that’s our promise.
